# 🧠 Toltek Toolbox Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision

Building on Toltek's mission to democratize high-quality data infrastructure and AI capabilities for SMBs, this toolbox provides ready-to-deploy, modular AI solutions that integrate seamlessly with our existing data stack (GCP, dlt, dbt, BigQuery, Terraform).

### Our Strategic Approach
We target small companies and start-ups/scale-ups willing to move fast, deploying our stack and accumulating business cases before moving to bigger clients. This approach follows two distinct phases:

**Build-up Phase**: Focus on rapid deployment with smaller, agile companies to validate use cases and build our toolbox
**Deployment Phase**: Scale to larger enterprises with proven solutions and established track record

### Our Strengths
- **Strong Business Skills**: Deep understanding of business processes and ROI drivers
- **Technical Trend Mastery**: Expertise in reducing complexity and technical debt through modern, modular approaches
- **High Modularity**: Flexible stack design enabling rapid customization and deployment
- **Proven Data Stack**: 10+ years of experience with GCP, dlt, dbt, BigQuery, Terraform
